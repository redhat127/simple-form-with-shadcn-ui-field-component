# React + TypeScript + Vite

i created a simple form using the new `field` component from `shadcn/ui` for improved form styling and structure. The form demonstrates how to integrate custom form field components like `Field`, `FieldLabel`, `FieldGroup`, `FieldDescription`, `FieldContent` and others to build accessible and organized forms with validation using `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
